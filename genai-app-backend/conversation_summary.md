# GenAI App Backend - Conversation Summary

## Project Overview
This project is a serverless backend for a generative AI application built with AWS technologies:
- AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- AWS Lambda for serverless compute
- Amazon API Gateway for RESTful endpoints
- Amazon Bedrock for AI model access (specifically Nova Lite model)

The current implementation includes:
- A Lambda function (orchestrator) that processes user prompts and sends them to Amazon Bedrock
- An API Gateway endpoint (/genai) that accepts POST requests
- IAM roles and policies configured for secure Bedrock model access
- Environment configuration for the Bedrock model ID (us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0)

## Suggested Improvements
Several improvements were identified for the project:

1. **Add Image Generation Support** - Implement Lambda function for image generation using Bedrock's image models
2. **Implement Error Handling** - Add robust error handling with try/except blocks
3. **Add Input Validation** - Validate user prompts before sending to Bedrock
4. **Enhance Security** - Add authentication, request throttling, and consider AWS WAF
5. **Improve Observability** - Add structured logging, CloudWatch metrics, and alarms
6. **Optimize Performance** - Consider caching, response streaming, and Lambda memory optimization
7. **Add Testing** - Implement unit and integration tests
8. **Enhance Infrastructure** - Add CI/CD pipeline and environment-specific configurations
9. **Documentation Improvements** - Add API documentation and usage examples
10. **Cost Optimization** - Implement token counting and budget alerts
11. **Feature Enhancements** - Add support for different models and parameter customization

## Implementation Plan
We began implementing the image generation functionality:

1. Create a new Lambda function (`image_generator/index.py`) that:
   - Accepts a text prompt
   - Uses Amazon Nova Canvas model for image generation
   - Returns a base64-encoded image
   - Includes proper error handling

2. Update the CDK stack to:
   - Add the new Lambda function with appropriate permissions
   - Create a new API Gateway endpoint (/image)
   - Configure environment variables for the image model ID

This implementation will complete the functionality mentioned in the README but not yet implemented in the code.
